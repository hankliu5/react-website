# Yu-Chia "Hank" Liu

Hello everyone!

I’m Hank, the second-year UCSD master’s student from chemical engineering. I started to take CS courses from last winter quarter (1 year ago). The reason I start to programming is when I was an undergrad student, I had to deal with lots of data from my experiments that took lots of time to calculate the results for human beings. At that point, I thought that could be my career goal if I have both computer science and chemical engineering background so that I can develop software for simulations or modeling on scientific fields.

I can program with Java, C++, and C. I used to learn Rails but I found I'm not really interested in web development (for now at least). Right now I'm learning Python for scientific fields.
